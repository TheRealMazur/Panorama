# Panorama
A project of an automated photo-panorama system. The idea was to use an microcontroller with WiFi and an captive portal site to ensure the ability to control the system with almost any device. It also features an relay that can be connected as shutter remote.

The code was written for ESP8266 microcontroller and stepper motor with an A4988 driver.

It works as a proof of concept, but needs an encoder for closed loop control with heavier photo gear.

You can see a prototype in work on [this video](https://youtu.be/dyb1aO_bBYM)
